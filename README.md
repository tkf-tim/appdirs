##Who we are

The OpenVnmrJ project as a community revolves around OpenVnmrJ as a piece of software. OpenVnmrJ resulted from the open-source release of commercial software for running NMR spectrometers. We are a group of open-source developers and users who develop, use, document, and promote OpenVnmrJ, NMR spectrometers and data stations running OpenVnmrJ, and other related activities for our mutual benefit.

##OpenVnmrJ

OpenVnmrJ is the outsourced parts of VnmrJ 4.2, used for NMR Data processing and acquisition. The software runs on Linux: Centos 6 and Ubuntu 14.02, Trusty Tahr are the targetted hosts.

OpenVnmrJ is designed to be very extensible with:
- A rich set of macros, written in MAGICAL
- A very configurable interface, using XML assets
- A comprehensive library of pulse programs, written in C, usually with macros and XML files to ease setting up experiments and processing data
- All these are open sourced and can use help to maintain code, fix bugs, add new features, and improve the user experience for all uses of OpenVnmrJ.

##Using repository
This repository is for people that want to download, compile, fix and contribute back to the community. 

If you only want to download and run OpenVnmrJ, you should get a pre-built archive and install a local copy. See Downloading.md for more information.

## Spectrometer users, read this 
** Do not delete the Agilent supplied VnmrJ on your spectrometer **
* Agilent service requires VnmrJ 4.2
* The spectrometer console software is NOT open sourced

## Blank Appdir
*Version 0.2 submitted by tkf-tim*

>blank—A Blank Appdir

This is a blank appdir to be used as a template

An appdir should have a LICENSE file, two text files—title and description—and several directories like this:

mysub----maclib--macro files
.......|-manual--manual files
.......|-psglib--pulse sequences (.c files)
.......|-parlib--parameter files for pulse sequences
.......|-bin--executables
.......|-templates--UX xml files
.......|-data--test data (FIDs)
.......|-LICENSE--(Apachev2 for inclusion into OpenVnmrJ)
.......|-description--(multiple lines with description of your appdir)
.......|-title--(single line with a human readable name)

This example has empty files named blank in each directory because git skips empty directories.
Delete the blank files if you copy this template.
