blank—A Blank Appdir

This is a blank appdir to be used as a template

An appdir should have a LICENSE file, two text files—title and description—and several directories like this:

mysub----maclib--macro files
.......|-manual--manual files
.......|-psglib--pulse sequences (.c files)
.......|-parlib--parameter files for pulse sequences
.......|-bin--executables
.......|-templates--UX xml files
.......|-data--test data (FIDs)
.......|-LICENSE--(Apachev2 for inclusion into OpenVnmrJ)
.......|-description--(multiple lines with description of your appdir)
.......|-title--(single line with a human readable name)

This example has empty files named blank in each directory because git skips empty directories.
Delete the blank files if you copy this template.
